class Solution:
    def reverseArray(self, arr):
        left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
        while left <= right:# i think <= is right call ,beacause when the number of elemenst in the array is add this is some what more right in my mind atleast
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
